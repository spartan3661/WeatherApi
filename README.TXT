-You can also enter a full address, press enter without inputting anything when prompted for state
-The weather api is probably US only and will return a error message when entering a location outside US
-Server somtimes returns a 500 error, try running the program again after a few minutes
-Enter Y or y at the end of the program to terminate it, anything else will cause the program to make another forecast
